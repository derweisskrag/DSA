# Architecture:

## Refining Your LinkedListâ€™s Design with Layered Architecture

Applying the layered architecture to your LinkedList might look something like this:

1. Physical Layer: The nodes and links in the LinkedList.
2. Data Link Layer: Basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, working generically with T.
3. Type Management Layer: Methods that check or manage the type of T, deciding which operation or method to call based
   on the type.
4. Balancing and Efficiency Layer: If you have any operations that optimize the list, such as balancing operations (
   though more common in trees), you might include them here.
5. Error Handling Layer: Centralized error handling, with informative messages guiding users.
6. User Interaction Layer: The API layer that users interact with, ensuring that they have a clear and consistent way to
   work with the list regardless of the type of T.
