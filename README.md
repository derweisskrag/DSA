# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction

This course, offered by the University of Tartu in Estonia, is taught by an esteemed
faculty member who wishes to remain anonymous. The objective of this course is to
provide students with comprehensive understanding about algorithms and data structures.
After completing the course, student is expected to be fluent in the algorithm language
and be able to leverage their knowledge effectively in the development of
their own applications.

## Overview of the course

n this section, I will outline the course topics, which cover a range of data structures
and algorithms. The course begins with linear data structures and progresses to more
complex nonlinear structures such as trees and graphs. Following the data structures,
the curriculum delves into a variety of algorithms including Dijkstra’s,
Prim’s, Kruskal’s, Greedy, Kadane’s, and many others. The objective of this course is
to equip students with the ability to efficiently implement these algorithms in any
programming language, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their application and
functionality.

### List of topics

The course teaches about

1. Linked lists
2. Stacks and Queues
3. Graphs
4. Trees
5. HashTables
6. UnionFind
7. Sorting algorithms
8. Searching algorithms
9. Dijkstra, Kruskal, and Prim algorithms
10. Patterns

## Suggestions

This sections provides the lecture material review and recap. The purpose of it is to help
students to prepare for midterms, colloquiums and, most importantly, exams.

### How is it done?

There is no need to rewrite lecture materials, so I decided to summarize each lecture
and provide illustrations, examples, and others. In other words, I contributed to the
DSA course.


### Innovations! Coming to the 1.1 version of DSA (current 1.0)
